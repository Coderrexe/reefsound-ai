# ReefSound AI

ReefSound is a suite of AI products that use the sound which coral reefs produce to diagnose their health status. This is the code repository of our core AI models, which consist of model1 (VGGish feature extractor + Random Forest) and model2 (ResNet34), as well as further experimentations of other convolutional neural network backbones such as EfficientNet and NFNet.
